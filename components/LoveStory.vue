              We met in 2013. She was a cashier, and I was a bagger at SM Supermarket Sta. Mesa.
              One night, as I was looking for someone to go home with since I had no idea what jeepney to ride, her friend told me that Chi was heading the same way. I ran toward her, and when she smiled and agreed to accompany me, that simple ‚Äúsabay umuwi‚Äù became the start of something beautiful.

              Days turned into months. We got to know each other better, and one thing we both loved was snacking. From sharing biscuits, candies, chocolates, and marshmallows, we began sharing laughter, stories, and little moments that made our bond grow stronger.

            Eventually, we confessed our feelings through text messages. They were shy, sweet, and sincere. On December 26, 2013, at Trinoma Mall, Quezon City, we officially became a couple.

            The years that followed were filled with love, adventures, travels, challenges, and endless support for each other. From being workmates to best friends, and from best friends to lifelong partners, our journey led us here to the day we finally say ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

            Now, after more than a decade of love and laughter, we are excited to begin our next chapter as husband and wife. üíï
